Portal 2 Cooperative Single Player Mod v0.1 by Rex (and many others)

How to install:
1. Make sure you have the most recent version of Portal 2 installed on steam.
2. Unzip 'Portal 2 Speedrun Mod' folder into 'sourcemods' directory (its default location is 'Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/').
3. Restart Steam.
4. A new game, called "Portal 2 Coop SP" should appear in your library.

How to update:

Notes:
	-Cooperative is very different from single player, holding wheatley/frankenturrets are a great example of this.
	-This is a very rough version of the maps with some very awful hacks. 
	-There will be softlocks, bugs, glitches, etc.
	-Things are subject to change throughout the life of the mod. (Looking at you button glitches)
